# ts-service
A sample project for me to noodle around with TypeScript based on [this article](https://medium.com/@VincentSchoener/development-with-docker-and-typescript-75956e1af4ca).

### To Build
```
./node_modules/.bin/tsc
```

### To watch for changes
This leverages the `nodemon.json` file.
```
npm run start:dev
```
